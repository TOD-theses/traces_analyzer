Goal Based on the four transaction traces (2 normal, 2 reverse order), automatically determine several labels and metadata related to TOD. Danger This does not detect if the amount of a Selfedestruct changed, as this is directly taken from the state and not stored in the stack or memory. Are there other TODs that are not visible in traces? Danger We currently ignore, that the effects of a transaction can be reverted, either due an exceptional halt (out of gas, invalid instruction, etc.) or a normal halt ( RETURN , REVERT , STOP , SELFDESTRUCT ). For instance, even if a LOG statement is part of a trace, it can still be reverted. How should we handle this? Maybe as a CallFrame.reverted flag? Planned implementation Traces data Here is an example for one event of an executed SLOAD instruction: { \"pc\": 1157, \"op\": 84, \"gas\": \"0x1f7b1\", \"gasCost\": \"0x834\", \"stack\": [ \"0xd0e30db0\", \"0x3d2\", \"0x62884461f1460000\", \"0xd7a8b5b72b22ea76954784721def9efafa7df99d65b759e7d1b78f9ee0094fbc\", \"0x0\", \"0x62884461f1460000\", \"0xd7a8b5b72b22ea76954784721def9efafa7df99d65b759e7d1b78f9ee0094fbc\" ], \"depth\": 2, \"returnData\": \"0x\", \"refund\": \"0x0\", \"memSize\": \"96\", \"opName\": \"SLOAD\" } Warning The EIP-3155 also specifies an optional \"memory\" field. This is not included by REVM per default. However, it is necessary to understand inputs and outputs from some instructions, eg CALL and LOGx. Traces preprocessing In general, we try not to load the whole trace into the memory. To achieve this goal, we iterate through the lines and process them on the go. Between each processing step we only pass the necessary data forward and forget all irrelevant data. Map each JSON to a TraceEvent This step simply maps a trace event from JSON to a python class ( TraceEvent ). Currently this is only implemented for traces generated with REVM (based on EIP-3155). However, new implementations could map other traces formats to TraceEvent , as long as the necessary information is included in the trace. Parse Instruction s We start the process with an initial CallFrame , which stores who created the transaction and which contract/EOA is called. Then we iterate through the TraceEvent s, always looking at two successive TraceEvent s. Based on these events we create an Instruction object, which specifies the EVM instruction, its inputs and also its outputs. For some instructions the currently executed contract is important, so we link the current CallFrame to it. For instance, a SLOAD instruction loads the data from the current contracts storage. If we encounter a CALL we create a new CallFrame , or on a RETURN we go back to the previous one. To be sure, we also check if the depth parameter changes. If it changes, thought the instruction is neither CALL or RETURN , we raise an Exception. The Instruction includes: opcode program_counter call_frame [stack_inputs] (if it's a StackInstruction ) [stack_outputs] (if it's a StackInstruction ) [additional fields based on the instruction type, eg key for SLOAD ] Warning How should we treat inputs/outputs from/to non-stack? in particular, the memory for eg calls? Warning How should the CallFrame for DELEGATECALL be implemented? Split into code_address and storage_address ? Create EnvironmentChange s Based on two successive TraceEvent s, compute the change between the environments. This includes following changes: StackChange MemoryChange ProgramCounterChange CallDepthChange (?) ReturnDataChange (?) Analysis Instruction effect changes To understand, where the TOD occurs we compare the transaction trace from both cases. At each iteration, we compare the EnvironmentChange s of both traces. The first time they differ, is the point at which the same instruction had a different effect. This could happen at a SLOAD if the storage is influenced by the other transaction, a BALANCE , etc. This detection will simply report the instruction that was executed before the traces diverge. Requires : comparison of two traces access to EnvironmentChange s access to Instruction s Labels : TOD-source-instruction Warning Check if this also works for reverts. Note There could be multiple instructions that are directly affected by the previous transaction, however for all but the first instruction, it is hard to differentiate between a direct effect of the previous transaction, or an indirect effect through the first divergent instruction. Note The same could be achieved by looking at the instruction outputs. However, this would require an exact modelling of all instruction outputs. Checking the stack, memory and pc is easier and less error-prone. Instruction input changes To understand, which instructions are affected by the TOD, we compare if the same instructions were executed, and if they were given the same inputs. Create a counter that counts how often an instruction has been called. An instruction is identified by (pc, inputs). For instructions in trace A, increment it. For instructions in the other trace, decrement it. Requires : comparison of two traces access to Instruction s Labels : TOD-Amount, TOD-Recipient, TOD-Transfer, TOD-Selfdestruct ether profits list of affected instructions If this includes inputs from the memory, further: call input changes log changes token profits (through log changes) Instruction usage We record all executed unique instructions, eg to understand if hashing was used. We group this by the contract address that executed them. Requires : access to Instruction s access to CallFrame s Labels : cryptography usage (hashing, signatures) usage of recently introduce opcodes Warning Solidity uses keccak256 internally for mappings.
