# Traces analyzer

The analysis is currently done in two steps:

1. Parse instructions from traces (see [Parsing](./parsing.md))
2. Extract features of the instructions (see [Feature Extraction](./feature_extraction.md))
3. TODO: assign definitions, labels and other metadata to contracts (or contract groups)
