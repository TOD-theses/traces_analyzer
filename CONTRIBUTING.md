## Format the code

Run `make fmt` to format the code.

## Run the linter

Run `make lint` to run the linter.

## Test your changes

Run `make test` to run the tests.

Ensure code coverage report shows `100%` coverage, add tests to your PR.

## Build the docs locally

Run `make docs` to build the docs.

Ensure your new changes are documented.

## Commit your changes

This project uses [conventional git commit messages](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

## Makefile utilities

This project comes with a `Makefile` that contains a number of useful utility.

```bash 
❯ make
Usage: make <target>

Targets:
help:             ## Show the help.
show:             ## Show the current environment.
install:          ## Install the project in dev mode.
fmt:              ## Format/auto-lint code using ruff.
lint:             ## Run ruff check and pyright
test: lint        ## Run tests and generate coverage report.
watch:            ## Run tests on every change.
clean:            ## Clean unused files.
virtualenv:       ## Create a virtual environment.
release:          ## Create a new tag for release.
docs:             ## Build the documentation.
```

## Making a new release

This project uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) and tags releases with `X.Y.Z`
Every time a new tag is created and pushed to the remote repo, github actions will
automatically create a new release on github and trigger a release on PyPI.

For this to work you need to setup a secret called `PIPY_API_TOKEN` on the project settings>secrets, 
this token can be generated on [pypi.org](https://pypi.org/account/).

To trigger a new release all you need to do is.

1. If you have changes to add to the repo
    * Make your changes following the steps described above.
    * Commit your changes following the [conventional git commit messages](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
2. Run the tests to ensure everything is working.
4. Run `make release` to create a new tag and push it to the remote repo.

the `make release` will ask you the version number to create the tag, ex: type `0.1.1` when you are asked.

> **CAUTION**:  The make release will change local changelog files and commit all the unstaged changes you have.
